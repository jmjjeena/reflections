When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    -   When I intend to share my work with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    -   You may not want those changes made locally to be available to the 
        public on GitHub. There may be a feature that you'd rather have locally 
        than pushing that change to GitHub, rather than the sync being done 
        automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    -   forks allow you to get another repository to your own github account. 
        Allows you to make changes to it, without affecting the original repository.
    -   Clone copies one repository.  If you make changes to it, you can copy those 
        changes to the original repository.
    -   Branches allows you to deviate from the master branch within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    -   Benefit is in being up-to-date for new changes or improvements being added. 
        And also it is easier to commit your changes to remote repository if your 
        local copy is more updated.
