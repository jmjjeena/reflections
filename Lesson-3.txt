When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    -   When I intend to share my work with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    -   You may not want those changes made locally to be available to the 
        public on GitHub. There may be a feature that you'd rather have locally 
        than pushing that change to GitHub, rather than the sync being done 
        automatically.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    -   forks allow you to get another repository to your own github account. 
        Allows you to make changes to it, without affecting the original repository.
    -   clone copies one repository.  If you make changes to it, you can copy those 
        changes to the original repository.
    -   branches allows you to deviate from the master branch within a repository.
